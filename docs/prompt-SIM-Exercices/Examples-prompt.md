# Examples Prompt

## Marketing

Ask the AI for the best strategy to reply.

### PROMPT

``` md title=" Step (Strategies)"
Role: Marketing Analyst

Command: Provide an overall sentiment score

===
Product Review: 
There are more and more foldable screens now, and many people want to try them out.
However, if you're considering it as your main device, I wouldn't highly recommend it.
Firstly, there's the issue of software compatibility; not all apps are optimized for foldable screens yet.
Secondly, there's the heat dissipation issue.
Since foldable screens prioritize being lightweight and thin, heat dissipation isn't a primary focus, so the phone can get quite hot after prolonged use.
Lastly, the rate of updates and iterations for foldable screens is very fast.
In the next few years, they will certainly overcome their current shortcomings, and perhaps that would be the best time to get a foldable device.
Of course, if you just want to use it as a secondary device or want to try it out, it's still a good choice!

```

## CFO

Ask the AI to draft the email.

### PROMPT

``` md title="Step 2 - Email"
Role: You are the CFO of an FMCG company

Context: You are asked by you CEO to design a new budget evaluation prosses to increase your control over your companyâ€™s budget spent

Format: Create an evaluation matrix in the form of a table, include below: 
1. Different budget lines including contingency budget for unexpected incidents
2. Rating Standard 
3. Unplanned budget process
4. Approval standard
Command: Create a detailed evaluation form for the staff to fill out on expense application


``` 

### OUTPUT

``` md title="CFO"
Sure, here is a proposal for a detailed evaluation form for the staff for expense application:
Note:
 Each staff member should fill out this form for any imperatively needed expense, providing detailed justification for clarity.
 Rating should be assigned by the department head where 'high' means very essential, 'medium' means moderately necessary, and 'low' means not a competitive priority at that point in time. For contingency, the rating will be based on severity.
 Unplanned budget expenses will go through the same form but will have to be signed off by the head of the department and the CFO before the expense can be incurred.
 The approval level is based on certain thresholds in each department, where the manager can approve up to a certain amount, and above that, it requires director's approval. However, the contingency budget needs the CFO's approval.
This form will ensure a well-structured mechanism for budget evaluation and spending, enhancing the control over company's budget spent.
